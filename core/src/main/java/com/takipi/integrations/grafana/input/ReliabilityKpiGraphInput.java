 * A function charting a target reliability KPI for a selected set of apps. KPIs include:
 * reliability score, error volumes, new errors, increasing errors and more. The out put
 * can be set to chart results over time, grouping them by set report intervals (e.g. 1d, 7d,..)
 * or produce a single average value for each scored application.
 * 
 *  Example query for graph:

	ReliabilityKpiGraph({"volumeType":"all","view":"$view",
		"timeFilter":"$timeFilter","environments":"$environments", 
		"applications":"$applications", "servers":"$servers",
		"types":"$type","limit":"$limit", "pointsWanted":"$pointsWanted", 
		"transactionPointsWanted":"$transactionPointsWanted", 
		"reportInterval":"24h", "kpi":"$kpi"})
